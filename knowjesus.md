## THE GOSPEL MESSAGE

Do you KNOW for sure that you are going to Heaven? Most people do not know for sure. Most people just HOPE that their good deads outnumber their bad deeds and that it will be enough. That is not enough! The Bible says that there is only one way to Heaven and that is through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross.

The most important question you must consider is if you died today, and God himself asked you “why should I let you into my Heaven?”, what would you say?
The Bible says that you can KNOW that you are going to Heaven through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior. Below is an outline of the Gospel Message taken from the Bible (KJV). Read the passages and take a moment to consider what they are saying. Pray to God to reveal the truth to you as you read. God will not ignore your sincere efforts to understand the truth of salvation through His Son, the Lord Jesus!

### 1. God’s Plan:  Peace & Life - You can KNOW it!

1 John 5:9-13

>>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

John 3:16-17

>>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

### 2. Man’s Problem:  Sin & Separation!

Romans 3:9-23

>>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: Their feet are swift to shed blood: Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes. Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Romans 5:12

>>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:

Romans 6:23

>>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

### 3. God’s Solution:  Substitution!

Romans 5:6-8

>>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

### 4. Man’s Response:  Repent, Believe, Receive!

Romans 10:9-13

>>hat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

John 1:10-13

>>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
