Rev. Paul Estabrooks is senior communication specialist for Open Doors International, an organization founded by Brother Andrew that distributes Bibles, brings encouragement, training and other assistance to Christians living in areas where they are persecuted or are restricted in living out or sharing their faith and encourages them to reach out to others around them. Paul is a veteran foreign missionary with a deep concern for Christians in restricted countries. He has completed thirty-two years of ministry to Persecuted Christians with Open Doors International. Paul is the author of four books and a number of booklets. One is a major training manual used around the world entitled Standing Strong through the Storm. His latest volumes are Escape from North Korea and Night of a Million Miracles: The Inside Story of Project Pearl.

Paul joined Open Doors-Asia in 1979 as Research Manager for the Asia region. Prior to joining Open Doors, he served eight years with the Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC) in Manila, Philippines, as head of Overseas Radio Programming. There he studied the Tagalog language and he and his wife adopted a Filipino baby girl, Melinda (now a co-host on Full Circle on Crossroads Television). He also served Open Doors for three years as Southeast Asia Coordinator—based in Singapore—as well as Director for Canada for five years, and has led mission trips to Asia for many years.

Paul graduated from Tyndale University College (LCBM - London, Ontario) in 1966 with a Bachelor of Theology degree. He later received a Bachelor and Master of Arts (with distinction) from Wayne State University in Detroit. He and his wife, Dianne, have been married for forty-six years, have three grown children and seven grandchildren and make their home in London, Ont.
